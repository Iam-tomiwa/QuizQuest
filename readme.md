## Possible Improvements

While the Quiz App is functional, here are some possible improvements that could enhance its development and user experience:

- **Using MUI library for more consistent component design:** Incorporating a UI component library like Material-UI (MUI) can provide a consistent and visually appealing design across the app's components.

- **Using react-hook-form to manage forms:** Implementing react-hook-form can simplify form handling and validation, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

- **Using Redux Toolkit to manage state and API calls:** Introducing Redux Toolkit can centralize state management and simplify asynchronous API calls.
